# Stanford CS229: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
## Lecture Notes with Personal Applications
In the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, few names command as much respect and recognition as Andrew Ng. This repository is dedicated to exploring the invaluable source of knowledge provided by Stanford University's CS229: Machine Learning course, taught by Dr. Andrew Ng himself. Widely regarded as a pioneer in the field of machine learning, Dr. Ng's course has been a cornerstone in the education of countless aspiring data scientists, engineers, and researchers around the globe. 

In this repository, you'll find a collection of lecture notes that provide a comprehensive overview of the foundational concepts, algorithms and techniques in machine learning. I tried to take it a step further by applying these principles to different examples and scenarios from the ones given in the course with the aim of strengthening the learning process and one day becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

As a personal and educational challenge I intend to cover all CS229's lectures so this repository will be updated regularly.
